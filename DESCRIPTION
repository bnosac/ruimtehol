Description: Wraps the 'StarSpace' library <https://github.com/facebookresearch/StarSpace> 
    allowing users to calculate word, sentence, article, document, webpage, link and entity 'embeddings'. 
    By using the 'embeddings', you can perform text based multi-label classification, 
    find similarities between texts and categories, do collaborative-filtering based recommendation 
    as well as content-based recommendation, find out relations between entities, calculate 
    graph 'embeddings' as well as perform semi-supervised learning and multi-task learning on plain text. 
    The techniques are explained in detail in the paper: 'StarSpace: Embed All The Things!' by Wu et al. (2017), available at <arXiv:1709.03856>.
