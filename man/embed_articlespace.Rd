\title{Build a Starspace model for learning the mapping between sentences and articles (articlespace)}
\usage{
embed_articlespace(x, model = "articlespace.bin", p = 1, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a data.frame with sentences containing the columns doc_id, sentence_id and token 
The doc_id is just an article or document identifier, 
the sentence_id column is a character field which contains words which are separated by a space and should not contain any tab characters}

\item{model}{name of the model which will be saved, passed on to \code{\link{starspace}}}

\item{p}{the percentage of the data that will be used as training data. If set to a value smaller than 1, 1-p percentage of the data which will be used as the validation set and early stopping will be executed. Defaults to 1.}

\item{...}{further arguments passed on to \code{\link{starspace}} except file, trainMode and fileFormat}
}
\value{
an object of class \code{textspace} as returned by \code{\link{starspace}}.
}
